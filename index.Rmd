# Class Structure
Student groups should be no more than two. Ideally each student has their own kit of supplies. In our testing sometimes one student in a pair would tend to dominate the supplies. This seemed to be due to an uneven amount of interest between the students. Slightly less interested students will tend to sit-back and let the more dominant student do the work. This denies that student the opportunity to develop interest and self-engage. Careful pairing or having them take turns for each activity may help.

# Materials

For each group:

* Breadboards (1)

* Jumper wires (several)

* RGB LED (1)

* Red LED (1)

* 10 kÎ© resistors (2)

* 555 Timer (1)
