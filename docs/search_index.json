Ideally each student has their own kit of supplies. In our testing sometimes one student in a pair would tend to dominate the supplies. This seemed to be due to an uneven amount of interest between the students. Slightly less interested students will tend to sit-back and let the more dominant student do the work. This denies that student the opportunity to develop interest and self-engage. Careful pairing or having them take turns for each activity may help. "],

You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #.

After building the circuit, ask an instructor to check it before flipping the power switch on the battery. After flipping the power switch, electrical current will flow from the battery’s red wire, through the resistor and red LED, and back to the battery through the black wire. The red LED should start to glow if you did everything correctly. Ask for help if the red LED does not turn on. "],
